                    What is raw honey?
                </div>
                <div class="accordion__item__content1">
                    Raw honey is honey as it is in the beehive. Raw honey is made by extracting honey from the
                    honeycombs and separating it from impurities. It doesn't contain any hidden sugars and is not
                    pasteurized or processed.

                    We sell pure organic honey but it can cause allergies, indeed. Typical symptoms are the same
                    as common pollen allergy symptoms: runny nose, sneezing, and swelling.

                    We bottle honey 3-4 times per year, according to the harvest seasons. Our
                    capabilities are limited to around 3000 jars a year. Therefore, depending on the
                    season, there may be different honey in our assortment, and some products may be
                    temporarily unavailable.
